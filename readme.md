## Introduction

Operating systems are the backbone of any computer system. They manage hardware resources and provide services for application software. This project dives into system programming, emphasizing system calls, which are the primary interface between a user program and the operating system.

## Features

- **System Call Implementation**: Explore how system calls function and their role in OS.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured to allow easy navigation and understanding.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each component is well-documented to aid learning.
- **Real-World Applications**: Understand how these concepts apply in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of C programming
- Familiarity with terminal commands

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vilaphab/GUIX_OS_ABYU_ZEWDU_SEC_A_1600628.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GUIX_OS_ABYU_ZEWDU_SEC_A_1600628
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up your environment.

## System Call Implementation

System calls provide the means for user-level applications to request services from the operating system. In this project, you will learn to implement various system calls, including:

- **File Operations**: Open, read, write, and close files.
- **Process Management**: Create and manage processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocate and free memory.

Each system call is designed to be straightforward, with clear examples and explanations.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can run the system call implementations. The following commands will help you test the functionality:

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   ./test_system_calls
   ```

### Example

Here is a simple example of how to use a system call in your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    ssize_t bytesRead = read(STDIN_FILENO, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, bytesRead);
    return 0;
}
```

This code reads input from the user and writes it back to the output.
